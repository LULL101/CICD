# Kubernetes Deployment Demo Project

HelloWorld Java application build and deploy in K8S via GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
The pipeline is implemented using GitLab's integration with [Kubernetes Cluster](https://jelastic.com/blog/kubernetes-cluster-scaling-pay-per-use-hosting/) that can be performed in a single click as it is covered in the Jelastic tutorial: https://jelastic.com/blog/kubernetes-gitlab-ci-cd-integration/
